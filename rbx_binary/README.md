More details about this crate are available on [the rbx-dom GitHub](https://github.com/Roblox/rbx-dom#readme).

Implementation of Roblox's binary model formats, rbxm and rbxl, for the rbx-dom ecosystem.

## Coverage
rbx_xml aims to support all property types from rbx_dom_weak, but it currently lags behind rbx_xml due to implementation complexity.

## Format
For a specification of what the format looks like, see [FORMAT.md](https://github.com/Roblox/rbx-dom/blob/master/rbx_binary/FORMAT.md).
